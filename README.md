# VORON STEALTHCHANGER XOL TOOLHEAD FAN SPLITTER

This little PCB allows you to connect 2 part cooling fans without having to splice or join cables. It fits the Xol toolhead when using it with Stealthchanger by DraftShift Design.

## FAQ
<B>Why does this exist?</B> Because currently, most NEMA14 toolhead boards don't have 2 separate part cooling fan ports, and I didn't like the idea of having to splice cables and to not be able to remove a fan without cutting cables.

<B>What does it fit?</B> It's a pretty niche board. If you have a Stealthchanger and you're using the Xol toolhead by Armchair Heavy Industries, this will fit neatly above the Tap sensor, below the extruder stepper motor.

<B>Does it work with any other setup?</B> Technically it'd work anywhere on a Voron you want to have two fans connected to a single port. As long as you've got room to physically fit the board, it'll work

<B>Is this needed?</B> No! You can quite easily use 2 part cooling fans and crimp / solder both fans ino a single JST connector.
